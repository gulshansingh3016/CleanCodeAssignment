1.As the program prints the highest and smallest number, so I name the class class
PrintHighestLowestValue.
2. Class C contains two declared variables a and b through which the largest and
smallest value is print, so the class name given is class OutputParameter and
variables a and b names changes to lowest and highest respectively.
3. Code inside Func1() function finds the lowest and highest so the name of the function
findHighestLowest.
4. n variable is for size of array so its name is sizeOfArray.
5. Int i is taken for index therefore its name change to index.
6. In a main method the int arr[] contains the input value and s is the size of the array so we name
it inputArray and size respectively.
